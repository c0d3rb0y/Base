# Base
 > An AI assistant that has a module system so that you can build on it easily.
# Features
<ul>
  <li>Simple module system</li>
  <li>ok at least i have the groundwork for a voice based version (currently a command line type thing)</li>
  <li>It will be able to order you pizza if you code a module to do so.</li>
</ul>

Module system is pretty simple, just add ```from base.utils import *``` at the start and you'll have access to all the AI's features. Documentation for that coming soon:tm:.
